        <h2>Chapter I. My Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro"> My name is Donnell Perkins and I have enjoyed working with technology for most of my life. When I
            was younger my dream job was to work at a AT&T. I thought showing people new features on thier phone was fun and a great way to connect with people. </p>
        <p> After graduating high school and taking a few college courses I didn't think programming was for me. So I instead 
            of taking classes with a focus in programming I learned about networking and facial recoginition software that was used to see where the user spends most of thier time when looking at websites or using an application.</p>
        <p> After I graduated with my first degree I landed a position working as a programmer. <span class="sentence">I
            never thought that progamming would be something that I would understand until I was thrown into it and had to figure it out.</span> Since I have been working as a programmer I have learned to enjoy it. </p>
        <p> When I am not learning about programming I am learning about my plants. As well as maintaining my mental health.
            Remembering to take many breaks so that I don't burn myself out. There is a lot of information to soak in and I don't plan to overwhelm myself.</p>
